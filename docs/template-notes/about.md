# About

### Where this project comes from

The theme scaffold was generated with this command and Jekyll 4:

```sh
$ jekyll new-theme NAME
```

Note that is similar to the `jekyll new` command.

### Package a theme

The part that allows this project gem to be packaged as an installable gem-based theme is this file:

- [jekyll-theme-quickstart.gemspec](/jekyll-theme-quickstart.gemspec)

The other parts like the config and Gemfile or the layout and includes directories are standard for a Jekyll project. The markdown pages in the root are included for a local demo and are not packaged in the theme.
